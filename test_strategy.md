Test Strategy and Automation Framework for StreamAMG Video Streaming Platform

### 1. Overall Test Strategy and Approach to Quality

Quality assurance strategy for StreamAMG's video streaming platform is to ensure an uninterrupted, high-quality, and 
scalable streaming experience for all users, particularly during unpredictable peak demands like live events.
Adopt a "Quality at Every Stage" approach, integrating testing throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC), from requirements gathering to post-deployment monitoring.

Core Principles:
Shift-Left Testing: Start testing as early in the development cycle, to identify and fix defects cheaply and quickly.

Automation First: Prioritize test automation for repetitive and stable test cases to achieve faster feedback cycles, improve efficiency and enable frequent regressions.

Risk-Based Testing: Focus testing efforts on high-risk, critical functionalities (e.g., content ingestion, live stream delivery, playback) that have the most significant impact on user experience and business operations.

Continuous Testing: Integrate automated tests into the CI/CD pipeline to provide immediate feedback on code changes and ensure continuous quality.

Proactive Monitoring: Implement robust monitoring and alerting for production environments to quickly identify and address issues, especially during live events.

User-Centric Quality: Always consider the end-user experience as the ultimate measure of quality, focusing on performance, reliability and usability.

### 2. Testing Pyramid / Approach for a Streaming Platform

The Streaming Test QA Pyramid:
1.  Unit Tests: 
        Focus: Individual functions, methods, and components (e.g., video encoding modules, API parsers, data validation logic).          
        Implementation:Developed by developers; QA engineers contribute by defining acceptance criteria and reviewing tests.  
        Benefit: Extremely fast feedback, isolate defects to specific code units.
    
    3.  API Tests:
    Focus: Interaction with backend services, content management APIs, user authentication, content delivery network (CDN) configurations, metadata handling.  
    Implementation: Automated using tools like Pytest + Requests.  
    Benefit: Fast execution, stable, independent of UI, allows early validation of backend logic and data flow. Crucial for content integrity and availability.  

4.  Component/Integration Tests:  
    Focus: Verifying the interaction between multiple integrated components.  
    Implementation: Automated, often building upon API tests or specialized tools.  
    Benefit: Ensures that different parts of the system work together as expected, catching integration issues early.  

5.  UI/End-to-End Tests:  
    Focus: Simulating real user journeys across the application's UI on various devices (e.g., navigating to a live event, initiating playback).  
    Implementation: Automated using tools like Playwright or Selenium and multi-device testing.  
    Benefit: Validates the complete user experience, critical paths.  

6.  Performance & Load Tests:  
    Focus: System responsiveness, stability, and scalability under various load conditions, especially during peak traffic. API response times under load, 
    concurrent user limits.  
    Implementation: Tools like JMeter  
    Benefit: Identifies bottlenecks, ensures the platform can handle unpredictable scale requirements.  

7.  Exploratory/Manual Tests (Apex - Human Insight):  
    Focus: Uncovering unexpected defects, validating usability and assessing the overall "feel" of the application, especially for new features or complex 
    scenarios that are hard to automate.  
    Benefit: Provides human intuition and catches issues that automation might miss. Essential for subjective quality aspects like video quality perception.  

### 3. Requirements Breakdown and Test Approach

### 3.1. API Testing for Content Management Endpoints

Objective: Ensure content can be reliably ingested, updated, retrieved, and deleted via the content management APIs and that access controls are enforced.
Test Approach:
   CRUD Operations: Comprehensive test cases for Create, Read, Update, Delete functionalities for various content types (VOD, Live Event metadata).
   Schema Validation: Validate API responses against expected JSON schemas to ensure data consistency.
   Error Handling: Test invalid requests, missing parameters, authentication failures and others to ensure appropriate error responses.
   Authorization/Authentication: Verify that only authorized users can perform sensitive operations.
   Data Integrity: Ensure that data stored via API calls is consistent and correctly reflected downstream (e.g., in databases or CDN caches).
   Automation Framework: Pytest with `requests` library. Reusable `ApiClient` class to abstract HTTP requests.

### 3.2. Performance Testing Considerations for Streaming Services

Objective: Assess the system's ability to maintain high performance and availability under various load conditions, particularly concurrent users and high data throughput.

    Stress Testing:Push the system beyond its expected limits to find breaking points and understand its behavior under an extreme load.
    Scalability Testing: Evaluate how the system scales (horizontally/vertically) when load increases, focusing on CDN performance, transcoder capacity, and API throughput.
    Endurance/Soak Testing: Run tests over extended periods to identify memory leaks, resource exhaustion or degradation over time.
    Peak load simulation (e.g., during a football match), content delivery under concurrency
Key Metrics:
    API response times (e.g., for manifest requests, content metadata).
    Concurrent user capacity for live and VOD streams.
    Start-up time (time to first frame).
    Buffering ratio, re-buffering events.
    Throughput (Mbps).
    Error rates.
    Resource utilization (CPU, memory, network) of servers, transcoders, and databases.

### 3.3. Test Scenarios for Multi-Device Compatibility

Objective: Ensure a consistent and high-quality streaming experience across a wide range of devices, operating systems and browsers.
Test Approach:
    Device Matrix: Define a representative matrix of target devices, OS versions, browsers and network conditions (e.g., mobile, desktop, smart TVs, laptops, different internet speeds).
                   Prioritize based on user analytics.
    Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) Testing: Verify that the player correctly switches between different quality renditions based on network conditions and device capabilities.
    DRM/Content Protection: Test content playback with Digital Rights Management (DRM) schemes on all supported devices.
    UI Responsiveness: Ensure the player UI and surrounding application adapt correctly to different screen sizes and orientations.
    Playback Controls: Verify play/pause, seek, volume, full-screen, and quality selection work as expected.
    Network Interruption: Simulate network drops and recoveries to test player resilience.
Key Scenarios:

    Buffering, seek accuracy, fallback to alternate stream, Testing all fallback alternative streams.
    Adaptive bitrate check, network loss, injecting latency spike in streaming.
    live-streaming on mobile devices with 4G/5G network.

### 4. Adapting Test Approach During Peak Traffic Events

Objective: During peak traffic events (e.g., major live sports, breaking news) testing approach shifts from broad coverage to highly focused, critical path validation and proactive monitoring.
    Prioritization: Focus on critical user journeys and core functionalities.
    Automated Smoke/Health Checks: Run continuous, rapid automated smoke tests on core APIs and a few critical playback scenarios to ensure system health. 
    Increased Monitoring: Intensify real-time monitoring of key performance indicators (KPIs) like stream health, CDN latency, API response times, error rates. Dashboards become the primary "test" tool.
    Targeted Load Injection: If possible, execute small, targeted load tests on specific components if concerns arise, rather than full-scale stress tests that could impact live users.
    Dedicated War Room/Incident Management: Establish a dedicated team to monitor, troubleshoot and resolve issues immediately. QA provides critical insights from pre-event testing and monitoring data.
    A/B Testing: Use feature flags to safely roll out new features to a small percentage of users before wider release, minimizing impact during peak.
    Fast Feedback Loop: Expedite the reporting and resolution of any issues discovered, leveraging direct communication channels between QA, Ops and Dev.

### 5. Balancing Test Coverage with Delivery Speed

Objective: Achieving an optimal balance between comprehensive test coverage and rapid delivery speed is crucial.
Strategic Test Pyramid Application:
    Maximize Unit & API Tests: These are fast, stable and provide high ROI, allowing developers to get quick feedback and prevent defects from propagating. This forms the bulk of our automated tests.
    Selective UI/E2E Tests: Keep UI tests lean and focused on critical user flows that cannot be adequately covered at lower layers. 
    Targeted Performance Tests: Run comprehensive performance tests less frequently (e.g. weekly, or before major releases/events) but continuously monitor key performance metrics.

Risk-Based Test Prioritization:
    High-Risk Areas: Critical paths, new features, and areas with a history of defects receive higher test coverage.
    Low-Risk Areas: Well-established, stable functionalities with minimal changes might have less exhaustive test coverage, relying on regressions.

Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):
    Automated Gates: Integrate all automated tests into the CI/CD pipeline. Unit tests run on every commit, API tests on pull requests, and a broader suite on release branches.

Test Data Management: Efficiently manage test data to ensure tests are repeatable, isolated, and quick to set up. Use factories or synthetic data generation where appropriate.

Effective Test Automation Framework:
    Maintainability: Design the framework for readability, reusability and easy updates.
    Modularization: Build framework in modules wise and scalability. 
    Parallelization: Enable running tests in parallel to reduce execution time.

Exploratory Testing: Supplement automated tests with targeted exploratory sessions for new features or complex interactions, leveraging human intuition to find subtle bugs quickly without requiring upfront automation.

Feedback Loops & Metrics:
Monitor test execution times, test coverage metrics, and defect escape rates. Use these metrics to continuously refine the test strategy and identify areas for improvement in both coverage and speed.
Post-release monitoring and analytics provide invaluable feedback on what testing missed and helps refine future testing efforts.

By consciously applying these strategies, aim to deliver high-quality streaming services rapidly and reliably, adapting our testing intensity based on risk, system maturity and operational needs.
