### Assumptions

- No access to the real StreamAMG API endpoints, https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com used for demonstration.
- API responses are assumed to have a typical REST structure with JSON payloads and standard status reposes.
- Performance and streaming-specific tests are documented but not implemented due to time constraints.
- The live-streaming and multi-device compatibility tests are represented as test strategy documentation, not executable tests.
- API base URL: `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com`
- Authentication is not required (assumed bypassed/mocked)
- Devices are tested via hypothetical compatibility matrices (not executed)
- API Endpoints: Assumed standard RESTful API endpoints for content management 

### Simplifications Made
No UI Automation: Given the focus on API and streaming backend/functional aspects, and the time limit, 
                  UI automation (e.g., Selenium/Playwright) was excluded from the implementation, though it is discussed in the TestStrategy.
Limited Data Variation: A real-world scenario would involve more extensive data sets.
Simulated Performance Testing: Actual load generation and detailed performance monitoring are beyond the scope of this implementation. 
No Complex Error Handling: The implemented tests include basic assertions for success/failure, but robust, production-grade error handling and 
                           retry mechanisms within the test automation code are simplified.
